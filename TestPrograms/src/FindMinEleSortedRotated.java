    * A sorted rotated array has two parts:
      Left portion where elements are larger.
      Right portion where elements are smaller.
    * The minimum element is the pivot point where the rotation occurs.
    * A property of the rotated sorted array:
       The rightmost element helps determine which part of the array the middle element belongs to.
